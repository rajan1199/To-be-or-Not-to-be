# To-be-or-Not-to-be

This is a machine learning project in which I predicted whether a person will die or not based on the attributes given in the training dataset and I was 76% successful in predicting the correct answer on the test dataset which is well evident from the screenshot (Result Sheet Codalab.jpg) of the result given in this repository itself.

I compared different classification algorithms and after the entire analysis made a final jupyter notebook named as Final.ipynb in this repository to give the entire overview of the project.

The link to competition as well as the link to the datasets is given as follows:
